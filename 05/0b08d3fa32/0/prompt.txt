Review this plan thoroughly before making any code changes. 
For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give me an opinionated recommendation, and ask for my input before assuming a direction.

My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):
- ﻿﻿DRY is important-flag repetition aggressively.
﻿﻿- Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
﻿﻿- I want code that's "engineered enough" - not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
﻿﻿- I err on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness > speed.
- ﻿﻿Bias toward explicit over clever.

## 1. Architecture review
Evaluate:
﻿﻿- Overall system design and component boundaries.
﻿﻿- Dependency graph and coupling concerns.
﻿﻿- Data flow patterns and potential bottlenecks.
- ﻿﻿Scaling characteristics and single points of failure.
﻿﻿- Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries).

## 2. Code quality review
Evaluate:
- ﻿﻿Code organization and module structure.
- ﻿﻿DRY violations-be aggressive here.
- ﻿﻿Error handling patterns and missing edge cases (call these out explicitly).
- ﻿﻿Technical debt hotspots.
- ﻿﻿Areas that are over-engineered or under-engineered relative to my preferences.

## 3. Test review
Evaluate:
﻿﻿- Test coverage gaps (unit, integration, e2e).
﻿﻿- Test quality and assertion strength.
﻿﻿- Missing edge case coverage-be thorough.
- ﻿﻿Untested failure modes and error paths.

## 4. Performance review
Evaluate:
- ﻿﻿N+1 queries and database access patterns.
- ﻿﻿Memory-usage concerns.
﻿﻿- Caching opportunities.
﻿﻿- Slow or high-complexity code paths.

## For each issue you find:
For every specific issue (bug, smell, design concern, or risk):
﻿﻿- Describe the problem concretely, with file and line references.
﻿﻿- Present 2-3 options, including "do nothing" where that's reasonable.
- ﻿﻿For each option, specify: implementation effort, risk, impact on other code, and maintenance burden.

﻿﻿Do not assume my priorities on timeline or scale.
﻿﻿After each section, pause and ask for my feedback before moving on.

Look at @misc/FRONTEND_REVIEW.md and @misc/PROJECT_REVIEW.md as well for existing issues, but use as reference only. Keep exploring, because we want it to be structured.

Create issues (and sub-issues as well) in issues/ directory while following the issues/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md template. (Note that issues can be categorized into 4 projects: Platform (Frontend), Middleware, Backend, Infra. Testing will be written by developers itself to keep them accountable.)

"ARCH-01 notes a potential naming collision between your auth app and Django's built-in django.contrib.auth. The app's AppConfig.name may need to be something like "trivivo_auth" or
  "player_auth" to avoid registry conflicts — worth verifying before that issue is worked." - add this as a note to ARCH-01.
