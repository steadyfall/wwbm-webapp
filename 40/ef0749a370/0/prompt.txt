Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Prepend `source .env` to all pytest targets in Makefile

## Context

Tests require `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to be set (via `kbc/settings.py`'s `values.SecretValue`). This is currently stored in `.env`. Without sourcing it, all four pytest Make targets fail. The fix is to prepend `source .env &&` to every `uv run pytest` invocation in the Makefile.

`SHELL := /bin/bash` is already set at the top of the Makefile, so `source` is valid.

## Affected Targets

All four pytest-running targets in `Makefile`:

| Target | Line | Current command |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| `test` | 89 | `$(UV) run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html` |
| `test-failed` | 93 | `$(UV) run pytest --lf` |
| `test-functional` | 180 | `$(UV) run pytest tests/functional/ -v` |
| `test-pipeline` | 184 | `$(UV) run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=100` |

## Change

Prepend `source .env && ` to each of the four commands above. Since Make runs each recipe line in its own shell subprocess, the `source` and the `pytest` call must be on the **same line** joined with `&&`. The `SHELL := /bin/bash` declaration ensures `source` is available.

Example for `test`:
```makefile
test: ## Run pytest test suite with coverage reporting
	@printf "$(CYAN)>>> Running tests with coverage...$(NC)\n"
	source .env && $(UV) run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

## File to Modify

- `Makefile` — four lines changed, no other files touched

## Verification

```bash
make test
make test-failed   # (only if there are previously-failed tests)
```

`pytest` output should show `django: ... configuration: Dev` and tests should pass without `ValueError: Value 'SECRET_KEY' is required`.
