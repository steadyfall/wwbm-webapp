        Build your fortune by answering <span class="text-yellow-400">multiple-choice questions</span> correctly and moving up the ladder
        toward <span class="text-green-400">$1,000,000</span>!
    </p>
    <p>
        This game is a series of <span class="text-yellow-400">multiple-choice questions</span> that each have four possible answers (A,B,C,D).
        The contestant must answer 15 of these questions correctly, one at a time, to win <span class="text-green-400">$1,000,000</span>. As soon
        as the contestant answers a question <span class="text-red-500">INCORRECTLY</span>, the game is <span class="text-red-500">OVER</span> and they receive 1% of the
        collected prize money. Contestants also get three lifelines to assist them if they get stuck on a
        particular question.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Trivivo</i> questions are structured according to <span class="text-blue-400">4 different states</span> with
        each states increasing in difficulty. Questions that are grouped into the same states will all be of
        similar difficulty.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>The <span class="text-cyan-400">1st state (Questions 1 – 5)</span> will contain the easiest questions. [<span class="text-red-400">20 sec</span> per question]</li>
        <li>The <span class="text-cyan-400">2nd state (Questions 6 – 9)</span> will be slightly more difficult [<span class="text-red-400">40 sec</span> per question], followed by
            the <span class="text-cyan-400">3rd state (Questions 10 – 12)</span>. [<span class="text-red-400">50 sec</span> per question]</li>
        <li>The <span class="text-cyan-400">4th state (Questions 13 – 15)</span> will pose the most difficult questions of the game. [<span class="text-red-400">60 sec</span> per
            question]</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Lifelines</h2>
