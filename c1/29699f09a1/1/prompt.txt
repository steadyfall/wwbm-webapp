Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Create 2 Linear issues as sub-issues of TRI-24

## Context
Three logo-related tasks need to be tracked in Linear under the Trivivo team:
1. Resizing the logo and making it transparent on the main page
2. Investigating a transparent logo for the favicon
3. Looking into a new logo

Both should be created with the "default" issue template and linked as sub-issues of TRI-24
("Unify auth, game, and admin CSS surfaces to Tailwind design system").

## Key IDs
- **Trivivo team ID:** `f18dc596-a380-41d0-853c-d9df2b50fb38`
- **TRI-24 issue ID:** `fdc89a95-2012-44c1-9ab4-b32a898294a1`

## Steps

### 1. Find the "default" template ID
Use `mcp__linear-server__list_documents` or query available issue templates for the Trivivo team.
If the `create_issue` tool accepts a `templateId` parameter, pass it; otherwise create with
labels that match TRI-24's pattern (`area: frontend`, `quality: design`).

### 2. Create Issue A — Logo resize + transparency on main page
- **Title:** `Resize and make logo transparent on main page`
- **Team:** Trivivo (`f18dc596-a380-41d0-853c-d9df2b50fb38`)
- **Template:** default (if templateId is discoverable)
- **Labels:** area: frontend, quality: design
- **Parent:** TRI-24 (`fdc89a95-2012-44c1-9ab4-b32a898294a1`)

### 3. Create Issue B — Transparent favicon logo investigation
- **Title:** `Investigate transparent logo for favicon`
- **Team:** Trivivo (`f18dc596-a380-41d0-853c-d9df2b50fb38`)
- **Template:** default (if templateId is discoverable)
- **Labels:** area: frontend, quality: design
- **Parent:** TRI-24 (`fdc89a95-2012-44c1-9ab4-b32a898294a1`)

### 4. Create Issue C — Look into a new logo
- **Title:** `Look into a new logo`
- **Team:** Trivivo (`f18dc596-a380-41d0-853c-d9df2b50fb38`)
- **Template:** default (if templateId is discoverable)
- **Labels:** area: frontend, quality: design
- **Parent:** TRI-24 (`fdc89a95-2012-44c1-9ab4-b32a898294a1`)

### 5. Link as sub-issues
Use `mcp__linear-server__sub_issue_write` (or set `parentId` in `create_issue`) to attach
all three new issues under TRI-24.

## Verification
- Confirm both new issues appear in Linear under the Trivivo team
- Confirm each issue lists TRI-24 as its parent
- Note the new issue identifiers (e.g., TRI-XX) and report them to the user

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

Use the Linear MCP itself.

---

Create commit for current changes (incremental/standalone commmits) and link Linear issue in commit message.

---

Check if acceptance criteria and tests are fulfilled for TRI-51.

---

The app is running at port 8000. Use Playwright MCP to test, since this will be manual testing for now.
