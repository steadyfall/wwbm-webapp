This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

ARGUMENTS: 
Migrate two Django auth templates (signin.html and register.html) from Bootstrap 5 to Tailwind CSS. 

## Context
- Project: Trivivo (a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire-style trivia game)
- Working directory: /Users/himankdave/Documents/code/personal-gh/trivivo-tri-51
- Files to change:
  - templates/authentication/signin.html
  - templates/authentication/register.html
  - static/css/auth.css (remove magic layout classes only: .ml-25percent, .ml-27percent, .ml-32percent)

## Theme (must match)
The app uses a dark theme from base.html:
- `bg-black text-white min-h-screen flex flex-col` on body
- Emerald/teal accents (emerald-500, cyan), orange accents
- `{% load static tailwind_tags %}` + `{% tailwind_css %}` for Tailwind loading
- NO Bootstrap

## auth.css existing styles to PRESERVE (do NOT move to Tailwind — keep in auth.css):
- body background: `background-image: url(../img/nightsky.jpg)` + `color: whitesmoke`
- `.valid` and `.invalid` background image classes (used by JS)
- `.signinButton` and `.registerButton` button styles (complex shadows/gradients)
- `.signBackInButton` style

## What to change in auth.css:
- DELETE: `.ml-25percent`, `.ml-27percent`, `.ml-32percent` classes
- DELETE: `.vertical-center` class (replace with Tailwind in templates)
- DELETE: `.grey-bg` class (replace with Tailwind in templates)
- DELETE: `.whitesmoke` class (replace with Tailwind `text-white` in templates)
- DELETE: `#username, #password, #email, #password2` ID styles (replace with Tailwind in templates)
- DELETE: `#usernameInput, #passwordInput, #emailInput, #password2Input` ID styles (replace with Tailwind in templates)
- DELETE: `.form-control::placeholder` (add placeholder color/style via Tailwind on inputs: `placeholder:text-[#c9b0f5] placeholder:italic placeholder:text-sm`)

## Required changes per template:

### signin.html & register.html both need:
1. Change `{% load static %}` → `{% load static tailwind_tags %}`
2. Remove the entire footer JS block (lines 13-27, the jQuery script that crashes because footer doesn't exist)
3. Remove Bootstrap CSS `<link>` tag
4. Combine 3 Google Fonts requests into ONE combined URL:
   `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&family=Manrope&family=Open+Sans&display=swap`
   (keep the two preconnect tags, just replace the three separate link tags with one)
5. Remove auth.css link (styles for body bg-image, buttons etc. are kept)
6. Convert Bootstrap layout classes to Tailwind (see specifics below)

### signin.html specific:
- `<body class="d-flex flex-column">` → `<body class="flex flex-col">`
- outer div `.vertical-center` → `<div class="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">`
- inner div `container-xl py-4 style="width:25%"` → `<div class="w-full max-w-sm mx-auto py-4">`
- logo div `.text-center.mb-4` → `<div class="text-center mb-6">`
- card `.card.card-md.grey-bg` → `<div class="bg-[#222121] rounded-lg border border-neutral-700">`
- card-body `.card-body.m-2` → `<div class="p-6">`
- heading `h2.h2.text-center.mb-4.whitesmoke` → `<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-6 text-white">`
- messages ul: keep id="allAlerts", use `list-none p-0 text-center mb-3` on ul; for each li: Bootstrap alert class → Tailwind (error=`bg-red-700`, success=`bg-green-700`, warning=`bg-yellow-700`, info=`bg-blue-700`, else `bg-neutral-700`) all `text-white rounded px-3 py-2 mb-1`
- `.mb-3` form groups → `mb-4`
- `.form-label` → `block text-sm font-medium text-white mb-1` 
- `.input-group` → `flex rounded-md overflow-hidden border border-neutral-600`
- `.input-group-text` → `flex items-center px-3 bg-neutral-800 text-white border-r border-neutral-600`
- `.form-control` → `flex-1 bg-[#222121] text-white px-3 py-2 text-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-1 focus:ring-blue-500 placeholder:text-[#c9b0f5] placeholder:italic placeholder:text-sm`
- `.mb-2` → `mb-3`
- Remove `.input-group.input-group-flat` wrapper div (it wraps another `.input-group`, just keep the inner one)
- `.form-footer.m-1` → `<div class="mt-4">`
- Button: remove `.ml-25percent.w-50`, keep `.signinButton`, add `w-full` (button already has `w-full` in auth.css)
- "Forgot password" div: remove `.mt-1.ml-27percent`, add `mt-2 text-center`, keep inline style for color or use `text-[#fc7240]`
- Bottom "Don't have account" div: remove Bootstrap classes, use `text-center text-white mt-3`; link color → `text-[#00ffd0]` (no-underline)

### register.html specific:
- Same body/outer changes as signin
- inner div `style="width:37%"` → `w-full max-w-md mx-auto py-4`
- For each field row: remove `.row.align-items-center > .col-lg-10 > .input-group` Bootstrap grid; replace with just the input-group div directly (no col wrappers needed)
- Remove empty `.col-auto` divs
- helper text `<i><small class="whitesmoke">` → `<p class="text-white text-xs italic mt-1">`
- password requirements list: `<ul>` keep but add `list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-0.5`
- Button: remove `.ml-25percent.w-50`, keep `.registerButton`, add `w-full`
- Bottom "Already have account" div → same pattern as signin

## DO NOT change:
- The Django template tags: `{% csrf_token %}`, `{% for message in messages %}`, `{% url 'register' %}`, `{% url 'login' %}`, `{% include 'authentication/icons/...' %}`
- The input names, ids, types, autocomplete, placeholder attributes
- The `<script defer>` tags for signin.js and validator.js
- The icon includes

Change the background in both cases from the nightsky to a dark background, so that it looks like a clean transition when coming from the main page.

---

I don't see the changes being reflected when running a live demo. Use Playwright MCP to see what is going on.

I don't see the changes being reflected when running a live demo. Use Playwright MCP to see what is going on and use frontend-plugin for better design.

---

The signout page isn't matching the auth design. Do that as well. Note that for now, admin username is 'admin' and password is 'a1d2m3i4n5'. Use Playwright MCP for active debugging.

Make the logos on the auth page 20 px bigger and apply transparency to only show the logo.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial task**: User asked to work on Linear issue TRI-51, use frontend-design plugin, use git worktrees, branch name from Linear.

2. **TRI-51 details**: Migrate signin.html and register.html from Bootstrap 5 to Tailwind, fix mobile layout, remove auth.css magic layout classes, combine Google Fonts, remove footer JS crash.

3. **Git worktree**: Created at `../trivivo-tri-51` on branch `steadyfall/tri-51-migrate-signin-and-register-pages-from-bootstrap-5-to` from current branch `RE-updated-fe`. User initially rejected creating from `main`, wanted it from current branch.

4. **Frontend-design skill**: Used the skill to guide the migration. Wrote all three files (signin.html, register.html, auth.css).

5. **Background change**: User asked to change background from nightsky to dark background (bg-black). Removed background-image from auth.css, added bg-black to body in both templates.

6. **Live demo debugging**: User said changes not reflected. Used Playwright MCP. Found server wasn't running, needed `source .env && make run`. Found URLs are at `/auth/login/`, `/auth/register/`, `/auth/logout/`. 

7. **Three bugs found via Playwright**:
   - Logo oversized (height attribute ignored by Tailwind preflight) → fixed with `h-[50px] w-auto` class
   - Input backgrounds white (`@tailwindcss/forms` overriding) → fixed with `!bg-[#222121]`  
   - jQuery missing (removed with footer block but signin.js/validator.js need it) → re-added jQuery CDN

8. **Tailwind build issue**: New arbitrary classes not compiled. Root cause: needed explicit `NODE_ENV=development npx tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js ...` rebuild. The file watcher from `make run` wasn't picking up new arbitrary values.

9. **Signout page**: User asked to migrate signout.html to match auth design. Used Playwright to view it (logged in as admin/a1d2m3i4n5). Rewrote signout.html with same dark Tailwind pattern.

10. **Logo changes**: User asked for logos 20px bigger and transparency to only show logo.
    - Changed `h-[50px]` → `h-[70px]` on all three templates
    - First tried `mix-blend-screen` (didn't work - can't make white transparent on black)
    - Then tried `rounded-full` to clip white corners → rebuilt Tailwind → confirmed working

11. **Current state**: All auth pages (signin, register, signout) are on branch `steadyfall/tri-51-migrate-signin-and-register-pages-from-bootstrap-5-to` in worktree `../trivivo-tri-51`. Logo is 70px + rounded-full. All pages look correct.

Key files:
- `templates/authentication/signin.html` - fully migrated
- `templates/authentication/register.html` - fully migrated  
- `templates/authentication/signout.html` - newly migrated
- `static/css/auth.css` - cleaned up
- `tailwind_theme/static/css/dist/styles.css` - rebuilt manually each time

Important pattern: After every template change, must run:
```bash
cd trivivo-tri-51/tailwind_theme/static_src && NODE_ENV=development npx tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js --postcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ../static/css/dist/styles.css
```

Pending tasks: None explicitly mentioned after logo fix. The last screenshot showed the logo working correctly.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Work on Linear issue TRI-51: migrate `signin.html` and `register.html` from Bootstrap 5 + inline styles to Tailwind CSS, fix mobile layout, remove `auth.css` magic layout classes (`.ml-25percent`, `.ml-27percent`, `.ml-32percent`), combine Google Fonts requests, remove footer JS crash block
   - Use git worktrees with branch name from Linear (`steadyfall/tri-51-migrate-signin-and-register-pages-from-bootstrap-5-to`), created from the current branch (`RE-updated-fe`) not main
   - Use frontend-design plugin for template generation
   - Change background from nightsky image to `bg-black` (matching main app) for clean transition
   - Debug live demo issues using Playwright MCP
   - Migrate `signout.html` to match the dark Tailwind auth design
   - Make logos on all auth pages 20px bigger (50px → 70px) and apply transparency to show only the circular logo (remove white rectangular frame)

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Django + Tailwind CSS (`django-tailwind`, `{% tailwind_css %}`, `{% load static tailwind_tags %}`)
   - Tailwind JIT compiler — arbitrary values (`bg-[#222121]`, `h-[70px]`, `!bg-[#222121]`) must be compiled; manual rebuild required: `NODE_ENV=development npx tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js --postcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ../static/css/dist/styles.css`
   - `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin overrides input `background-color` with `#fff` — requires Tailwind `!important` modifier (`!bg-[#222121]`) to override
   - Tailwind preflight overrides HTML `height` attribute on `<img>` — must use CSS class `h-[70px]` instead
   - `mix-blend-mode: screen` does NOT remove white on black backgrounds (screen(black, white) = white); `rounded-full` clips square `.ico` frame to circle instead
   - Git worktrees: `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>` (from current branch, not main)
   - Django-configurations: needs `source .env` before `make run` for `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
   - Auth URLs: `/auth/login/`, `/auth/register/`, `/auth/logout/`
   - `validator.js` uses `.col-auto` Bootstrap DOM structure for validation icons — those divs were removed, `validOrInvalidPic()` silently no-ops; border-color validation still works
   - `mix-blend-screen` Tailwind class: `mix-blend-screen` (was tried but ineffective for white-on-black)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/Users/himankdave/Documents/code/personal-gh/trivivo-tri-51/templates/authentication/signin.html`** (fully rewritten)
     - Removed: Bootstrap CDN, footer jQuery crash block, 3 separate Google Fonts, `.vertical-center`, `style="width:25%"`, Bootstrap classes, `ml-25percent`/`ml-27percent` on button/link
     - Added: `{% load static tailwind_tags %}`, `{% tailwind_css %}`, jQuery CDN (cdnjs 3.7.1), combined Google Fonts, Tailwind layout classes, `!bg-[#222121]` on inputs, `h-[70px] w-auto rounded-full` on logo

   - **`/Users/himankdave/Documents/code/personal-gh/trivivo-tri-51/static/css/auth.css`** (cleaned up)
     - Removed: `.whitesmoke`, `.grey-bg`, `.vertical-center`, `.ml-25percent`, `.ml-27percent`, `.ml-32percent`, label/input ID styles, `.form-control::placeholder`
     - Kept: `body { background-image → REMOVED (changed to bg-black); color: whitesmoke; font-family }`, `.valid`, `.invalid`, `.signBackInButton`, `.signinButton`, `.registerButton`
     - Final body rule: `body { color: whitesmoke; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; }` (no background-image)

   - **Tailwind compiled CSS**: `trivivo-tri-51/tailwind_theme/static/css/dist/styles.css`
     - Must be manually rebuilt each time new arbitrary classes are added
     - Command: `cd trivivo-tri-51/tailwind_theme/static_src && NODE_ENV=development npx tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js --postcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ../static/css/dist/styles.css`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Footer jQuery crash**: `$(document).ready` block references `$('footer')` which doesn't exist on auth pages → `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` → Fixed by removing the entire jQuery block (lines 13-27) from all auth templates
   - **jQuery `$ is not defined`**: Removing the footer block also removed the only jQuery `<script>` include, but `signin.js` and `validator.js` use `$()` → Fixed by re-adding jQuery CDN script tag (cdnjs 3.7.1) in `<head>` without the footer JS block
   - **Logo oversized**: `height="50"` HTML attribute overridden by Tailwind preflight → Fixed with CSS class `h-[50px] w-auto` (later changed to `h-[70px]`)
   - **Input backgrounds white**: `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin sets `background-color: #fff` with higher specificity than `bg-[#222121]` → Fixed with Tailwind important modifier `!bg-[#222121]`
   - **Tailwind not compiling arbitrary values**: The file watcher from `make run` didn't pick up new arbitrary classes (`bg-[#222121]`, `h-[50px]`, `!bg-[#222121]`, etc.) → Fixed by running explicit `NODE_ENV=development npx tailwindcss -c tailwind.config.js ...` rebuild after every batch of template changes
   - **`mix-blend-screen` ineffective**: Tried `mix-blend-screen` to remove white logo background — mathematically screen(black, white) = white, so it has no effect on dark backgrounds → Replaced with `rounded-full` which clips the square `.ico` frame to a circle, hiding the white corners
   - **`rounded-full` not compiled**: Assumed it was pre-compiled but it wasn't in the CSS → Fixed by running Tailwind rebuild
   - **Server not running**: `make run` failed with `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` missing → User instructed to `source .env` first; command: `source .env && make run`
   - **Wrong logout URL**: Tried `/logout/` (404) → Correct URL is `/auth/logout/` (per CODEMAPS)
   - **Worktree from wrong branch**: Initially tried to create worktree from `main` → User rejected, wanted it from current branch `RE-updated-fe`

5. Problem Solving:
   - Tailwind JIT watcher not detecting new arbitrary values from auth templates: worked around by always running a manual one-shot rebuild after template edits using explicit `-c tailwind.config.js` flag
   - White rectangular frame around `.ico` logo on dark background: `mix-blend-screen` was incorrect approach; `rounded-full` clips the image to a circle, which matches the WWTBAM circular logo shape and hides the white square corners
   - `@tailwindcss/forms` specificity conflict: solved with Tailwind's `!` important prefix modifier

6. All user messages:
   - "Work on Linear issue TRI-51. Use frontend-design plugin as well, but don't make heavy changes - adhere to the general theme of the customer page. Use git worktrees and branch name should be from Linear."
   - "Create worktree from this branch." (rejected creating from main)
   - "Change the background in both cases from the nightsky to a dark background, so that it looks like a clean transition when coming from the main page."
   - "I don't see the changes being reflected when running a live demo. Use Playwright MCP to see what is going on and use frontend-plugin for better design."
   - "use `make run`" (when trying to start server differently)
   - "use docs/ to understand the project" (when searching for URL patterns)
   - "The signout page isn't matching the auth design. Do that as well. Note that for now, admin username is 'admin' and password is 'a1d2m3i4n5'. Use Playwright MCP for active debugging."
   - (Plan mode) "Yes, compact context and auto-accept edits" (approved signout plan)
   - "Make the logos on the auth page 20 px bigger and apply transparency to only show the logo."
   - (Plan mode) "Yes, compact context and auto-accept edits" (approved logo plan)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - No explicitly pending tasks remain. All requested changes have been implemented and verified via Playwright screenshots.

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was updating logos across all three auth templates:
   - Changed `h-[50px]` → `h-[70px]` (20px bigger)
   - Added `rounded-full` to clip the `.ico`'s white square border, showing only the circular logo
   - Applied to: `signin.html`, `register.html`, `signout.html` (all in `trivivo-tri-51/templates/authentication/`)
   - Rebuilt Tailwind CSS to compile `rounded-full` and `h-[70px]`
   - Verified via Playwright screenshot of `/auth/login/` — logo is 70px, circular, white corners gone, floats cleanly on black background

   All work is in the git worktree at `/Users/himankdave/Documents/code/personal-gh/trivivo-tri-51` on branch `steadyfall/tri-51-migrate-signin-and-register-pages-from-bootstrap-5-to`.

9. Optional Next Step:
   No pending tasks remain from the user's explicit requests. The last screenshot confirmed the logo changes look correct. The natural next step would be to commit the changes and potentially create a PR for TRI-51, but the user has not explicitly requested this. Await further instructions.

On the register page, the password rules' font style is in mismatch with rest of the field rules (ie. username, confirm password). Match the font style for password rules' as well (no italics, keep the bullet points) and put all of this inside a dropdown with title "Requirements". Use Playwright MCP and frontend-plugin for better visualization and ideas.
