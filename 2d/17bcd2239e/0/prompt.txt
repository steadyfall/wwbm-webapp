Implement the following plan:

# Plan: TRI-19 — Register auth and adminpanel apps in INSTALLED_APPS

## Context

`auth` and `adminpanel` are functional Django apps that are not yet listed in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Django's migration runner, signal dispatch, and management command autodiscovery all require app registration. Currently the project works by accident because `game` imports models that the other apps depend on — this is a hidden ordering dependency that will break on a fresh DB.

## Problem Analysis

There is a **label conflict** that must be resolved before registration:

- `django.contrib.auth` (already in `INSTALLED_APPS`) has an implicit `label = "auth"` (last part of its module path)
- `auth/apps.py` has `name = "auth"`, which also produces `label = "auth"` by default
- Django will raise a `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error if two apps share the same label

The fix is to add `label = "trivivo_auth"` to `AuthConfig` (keeping `name = "auth"` to match the directory). This is the Django-idiomatic approach — `name` must match the importable module path, while `label` is the short, unique identifier used for DB table prefixes and reverse lookups.

## Changes

### 1. `auth/apps.py` — Add unique label

```python
class AuthConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
    name = "auth"
    label = "trivivo_auth"   # avoids collision with django.contrib.auth's label
```

### 2. `kbc/settings.py` — Register both apps in the `Base` class

Add to `INSTALLED_APPS` after `"game.apps.GameConfig"`:

```python
"auth.apps.AuthConfig",
"adminpanel.apps.AdminpanelConfig",
```

## Critical Files

- `auth/apps.py` — add `label = "trivivo_auth"`
- `kbc/settings.py` — add both app configs to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `Base`

## Verification

After changes, from project root run:

```bash
python manage.py check
python manage.py migrate --check
```

Both commands should exit with 0 errors. `manage.py check` validates no duplicate app labels; `migrate --check` confirms all migrations are applied without skipping any.
